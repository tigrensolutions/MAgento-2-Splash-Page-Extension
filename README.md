# Magento 2 Splash Page Extension

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic; color: #ff0000;"><strong>WHAT IS THE SPLASH PAGE AND WHY IS IT NECESSARY?</strong></span></p>
The splash page is a page that precedes any page on your website such as the Homepage. It can be a welcome screen to the main website or a teaser that engages customers before going to the store. It’s worth noting all splash pages will have a noticeable and easy-to-find link to navigate away from the page.
In general, the website owners can use the splash pages for multiple purposes; however, for a Magento e-commerce store, there are 3 main reasons:

<h3><strong>1. Deliver a welcome message, a quote, or your business philosophy</strong></h3>
The first impression is always important, therefore it would be amazing to deliver a warm message on the splash page to the customers before accessing your store. You can put in a concise statement to introduce the buyers to your store, a quote that inspires them, or just simply a welcome message. As you might know, many surveys have shown that people tend to be less fastidious and purchase more when they are happy, so let’s make them excited and spend more money in your store.

<h3><strong>2. Captivate visitors’ attention to your promotions, latest products, news, etc.</strong></h3>

Using the splash page is one of the effective ways to notify and promote new products that many e-commerce stores haven’t thought about. By showing a splash page with attractive images of your new/featured items, you are “forcing” the customers to pay more attention and arouse their curiosity to find more information. Besides, the splash page is immensely useful to notify the buyers of your running promotion campaigns and send them valuable coupon codes. Consequently, owing to the splash page, you can easily intrigue the visitors and boost your sale as well.

<h3><strong>3. Notify the visitors when the store is coming soon or in maintenance</strong></h3>

Other common cases for applying the splash pages are when the website hasn’t been completed to be launched or in its maintenance period. The store owners need to use the splash page to inform the customers about their statuses and tell them to come back later.
